                <h3>Deadlines and Time Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Last semester I really struggled to meet course assignment
                    deadlines. I couldn't manage my time properly due to my bad
                    habits like sleeping late and waking up at 9am in the
                    mornings. I often started assignments late, which made me
                    feel rushed and stressed, and as a result, I couldn't have
                    time to review my assignments and my works quality.

                <h2>My action plan for learning</h2>
                <h3>
                    Building better study and work routines, and fixing my bad
                    habits
                </h3>

                <p>
                    I've made it a habit to begin each day with a plan. I stay
                    ahead on my homework, and beyond my BCIT courses, I focus on
                    personal growth by watching industry-related content on
                    YouTube. Above all, I'm learning to enjoy my experience at
                    BCIT and appreciate the journey.
